# Geometry-Pipeline
This repository implements a system focused on generating 2D points with specific constraints and searching for the closest points to form triangles. The project consists of two main components: the Generator, implemented in Python, and the Searcher, written in C. The Generator creates a set of 2D points that satisfy specific neighborhood constraints, ensuring a minimum distance between the points. The Searcher processes these generated points to identify the three closest points, checks if they form a valid triangle, and outputs the results accordingly.
